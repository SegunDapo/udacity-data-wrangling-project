It's a sharing feature when you want others to see something you've read/seen.*\n",

Also, during the holidays, they are more likely to share pics/etc about things they care about during this time i.e. their dogs.\n",

    "5. The overall trend of the counts shows the popularity of this twitter page slowly growing overtime. If the number of followers were taken into account, it would most likely show a similar trend since the twitter account is getting more \"air time.\""

# Udacity Data Wrangling Project


Data preparation is quite a serious job in all parts of a data analyst's work flow, in this project, I used the data wrangling skills to pull real-world data from Twitter, clean it, and do some analysis. I used the original Twitter data from Twitter user @dog_rates, along with an image prediction dataset, to build my analysis.  WeRateDogs is a popular Twitter hash tag, as the name tells, people rate dogs with a denominator of 10 and the numerator is usually higher than 10 to show how lovely the dog is.

The dataset that I wrangled (analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for students to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

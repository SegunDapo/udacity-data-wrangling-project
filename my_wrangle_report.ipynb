    "2. Column name __floofer__ should be spelled __'floof'__ (but entire column values can be left as floofer)\n",
    "3. __tweet_id__ has dtype int64 and should be object\n",
    "4. __timestamp__ should be a datetime64 dtype type as well\n",
    "5. Missing information for dog stages.\n",
    "6. Many missing names from the list under __'Name'__, and random names like __'a'__ and __'an'__ might be parts of strings that got taken out of context.\n",
    "7. Remove from table retweets and replies keepng only original tweets.\n",
    "8. Some tweets had __\"\\&amp\"__ combined with \";\" which is the html code to display just the ampersand, so that needs to be cleaned up.\n",
    "9. Some records have more than one dog stage\n",
    "10. Rating_numerator column has values less than 10 (e.g 0, 7) as well as some very large numbers (e.g. 130, 110)\n",
    "11. Rating_denominator column has values way other than 10 (way higher than 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image prediction table (df_img)\n",
    "1. The types of dogs in columns __p1__, __p2__, and __p3__ had some uppercase and lowercase letters.\n",
    "2. The __tweet_id__ column should be dtype object instead of int64.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tweet count table (df_twt)\n",
    "1. The column __id_str__ should be changed to __tweet_id__ so merging tables will be smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidiness Issues\n",
    "1. The __tweet_count(df_twt)__  data (retweet_count and favorite_count) should be merged into the __twitter-archive-enhanced(df_arc)__ table as it is the added data for the __twitter-archive-enhanced__ table.\n",
    "2. The __source__ column in the twitter-archive-enhanced table looks messy and clutters the table.\n",
    "3. __doggo__, __floofer__, __pupper__, __puppo__ columns in __twitter_archive_enhanced__ table should be in one column named __Stage__.\n",
    "4.  __df_arc__ without any duplicates (i.e. retweets) will have empty __retweeted_status_id__, __retweeted_status_user_id__ and __retweeted_status_timestamp__ columns, which can be dropped.\n",
    "5. __\"Breed\"__ column should be added in __df_arc__ table; its values based on __p1_conf__ and __p1_dog__ columns of __df_img__ (image predictions) table\n",
    "6. All three tables will eventually be merged into one."
